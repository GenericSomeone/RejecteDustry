# About
Please note: this mod is bad, unbalanced, and probably heresy.

It's *supposed* to be.

This repo is made entirely of low effort suggestions that people think are unironically good without giving any thought into how they would work in the game. The purpose of this repo is to show you *why* some of your ideas are awful so that people think twice before making a suggestion without any foresight. I made this repository partially out of spite, so don't expect any of this to be good. I will **NOT** be updating this mod regularly. This is simply a dumping ground for ideas that I find amusingly bad but too stupid for a real content mod.

Don't get me wrong: I love suggestions, and I personally think they are a great way for a mod author to reach out to their community. Interacting with your fanbase is never a bad thing. That said, some suggestions make me want to bang my head repeatedly on a concrete wall. Suggestions made with effort that simply don't fit into the mod well enough are one thing, but suggestions that give no regard to quality whatsoever are another.

Any suggestions (purposely stupid or otherwise) made for this mod will **NOT** be taken, as that goes against the spirit and purpose of the mod. Additionally, since I can't possibly make every rejected idea due to time and code contraints, I'll only be making the dumbest ones. That said, if you've rejected an idea for your content mod and you believe it to be stupid enough to make the hall of shame, you are more than welcome to make a pull request and make the rejected suggestion yourself. I won't stop you.

I hope this can teach you all something, and improve mod suggestions as a whole. Thank you.
