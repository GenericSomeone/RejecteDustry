# About
Please note: this mod is bad, unbalanced, and probably heresy.

It's *supposed* to be.

This repo is made entirely of low effort suggestions that people think are unironically good without giving any thought into how they would work in the game. The purpose of this repo is to show you *why* some of your ideas are awful so that people think twice before making a suggestion without any foresight. I made this repository partially out of spite, so don't expect any of this to be good. I will **NOT** be updating this mod regularly. This is simply a dumping ground for ideas that I find amusingly bad but too stupid for a real content mod.

Don't get me wrong: I love suggestions, and I personally think they are a great way for a mod author to reach out to their community. Interacting with your fanbase is never a bad thing. That said, some suggestions make me want to bang my head repeatedly on a concrete wall. Suggestions made with effort that simply don't fit into the mod well enough are one thing, but suggestions that give no regard to quality whatsoever are another.

# Crediting

Ideas are "credited" in the following format:

Suggested By: \<name of person who suggested the original idea, not the one who reported the idea to me\>

Original Mod: \<content mod that the idea was rejected from before it ended up here\>

Implemented By: \<name(s) of people who coded the idea, if this field is absent, it was made by me\>

\<text to describe any deviation from the original concept, if applicable\>

# Rules

Troll ideas intentionally made to be stupid will NOT be taken. The point of this mod is to get people to improve their suggestions. Trolls won't listen. However, I will be giving a very generous amount of leeway until I consider an idea to be a troll.

Any suggestions (purposely stupid or otherwise) made specifically for this mod will NOT be taken, as they go against the spirit and purpose of the mod. All ideas in the mod must have been rejected from at least one other content mod.

If I think an idea is well thought out and has potential, I will not be adding it here.

If you've rejected an idea for your content mod and you believe it to be stupid enough to make the hall of shame, you are more than welcome to report it to me. However, due to time and code constraints, even if the idea follows the above rules, it is not guaranteed that I will make it. That said, even if I do not end up making the idea due to said constraints, you are more than welcome to pull request and make the rejected suggestion yourself. I won't stop you.

I hope this can teach you all something, and improve mod suggestions as a whole. Thank you.
