# About
Please note: this mod is bad, unbalanced, and probably heresy.

It's *supposed* to be.

This repo is made entirely of low effort suggestions without giving any thought into implementation. As such, I will **NOT** be updating this mod regularly. This is simply a dumping ground for ideas that I find amusingly bad but too stupid for a real content mod.

Don't get me wrong: I love suggestions, and I personally think they are a great way for a mod author to reach out to their community. Interacting with your fanbase is never a bad thing. That said, some suggestions make me want to bang my head repeatedly on a concrete wall. Suggestions made with effort that simply don't fit into the mod well enough are one thing, but suggestions that give no regard to quality whatsoever are another.

# Crediting

Ideas are "credited" in the following format:

Suggested By: \<name of person who suggested the original idea, not the one who reported the idea to me\>

Original Mod: \<content mod that the idea was rejected from before it ended up here, if this field is absent, it was found through discord and was not a suggestion to any particular mod\>

Implemented By: \<name(s) of people who coded the idea, if this field is absent, it was made by me\>

Found By: \<name of person who passed the idea onto me, if this field is absent, it was found by me\>

\<text to describe any deviation from the original concept, if applicable\>

\<additional details, if applicable\>

# Rules

The only rule remaining is that ideas that I think have potential will still be excluded, as they belong elsewhere. Other rules used to be in place to limit the input of ideas, but they no longer seem necessary.

However, do note that unironically bad suggestions will be prioritized over joke suggestions, and will have a much greater chance of making it in.

All suggestions brought to me will be reviewed. Though not all will make it in, I will certainly try.
