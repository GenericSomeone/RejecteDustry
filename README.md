# About
This repo is a dumping ground for ideas that I find amusingly bad but too stupid for a real content mod. As such, I will **NOT** be updating this mod regularly. 

Don't get me wrong: I love suggestions, and I personally think they are a great way for a mod author to reach out to their community. That said, some suggestions make me want to bang my head repeatedly on a concrete wall. Suggestions made with effort that simply don't fit into the mod well enough are one thing, but stupid ideas that give no regard to quality whatsoever are another.

# Crediting

Ideas are credited in the following format:

Suggested By: \<username of person who suggested the original idea, not the one who reported the idea to me\>

Original Mod: \<content mod that the idea was rejected from before it ended up here; if this field is absent, it was found through discord and was not a suggestion to any particular mod\>

Implemented By: \<name(s) of people who coded the idea; if this field is absent, it was made by me\>

Found By: \<name of person who passed the idea onto me; if this field is absent, it was found by me\>

\<text to describe any deviation from the original concept, if applicable\>

\<additional details, if applicable\>

# Other Notes

Ideas that I think are unironically good will not be included, as they belong elsewhere. Also, do note that while all bad ideas are welcome, I prioritize bad suggestions over joke suggestions.

Not every idea will make it in, but I will certainly try.

Will this make it to v7? Tough to say, but my guess is probably not. I don't think anyone will miss it anyway...
